# Heart Failure Analysis using PostgreSQL

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing heart failure clinical data using **PostgreSQL**.
It demonstrates how relational databases can be used to store, manage, and analyze
medical datasets using SQL queries of varying complexity.

The project includes database creation, data insertion from a CSV file, and
multiple analytical queries ranging from basic to advanced level.

---

##  Dataset Description
The dataset contains clinical records of heart failure patients with attributes such as:
- Age
- Anaemia
- Diabetes
- High blood pressure
- Ejection fraction
- Serum creatinine
- Serum sodium
- Smoking habits
- Survival status (DEATH_EVENT)

Each record represents one patient and their medical condition during a follow-up period.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **PostgreSQL**
- **SQL**
- **CSV Dataset**
- **GitHub** (for version control)

##  Database Operations Performed
- Database and table creation
- Data import using CSV file
- Data retrieval using SELECT queries
- Filtering and aggregation using WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING
- Medium and advanced SQL queries such as:
  - CASE statements
  - Subqueries
  - Views
  - Aggregate analysis
  - Conditional logic
